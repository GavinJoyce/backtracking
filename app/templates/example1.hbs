    You'll see a "Assertion Failed: You modified model.name twice on [object Object] in a single render. This was unreliable and slow in Ember 1.x and is no longer supported. See https://github.com/emberjs/ember.js/issues/13948 for more details." in the console.

  <p>
    To avoid this error, don't modify any properties that have already been rendered in parent templates.

<div class="explain">
  Ask yourself why you are using component lifecycle hooks to modify non-local state. Presumably, something caused the component to be rendered. You should modify the state at that point instead (possibly an action).

<strong>Here's where we render the value:</strong> hi {{model.name}}

<h3>Case 1: In a route template</h3>

<button {{action 'toggleComponent'}}>Toggle Component</button>

{{#if showComponent}}
  {{component-that-changes-name-on-init person=model}}
{{else}}
  Press the "Toggle Component" button to trigger the error (look in the console)
{{/if}}

<hr />

<h3>Case 2: In a component template</h3>
{{component-that-wraps-the-component-that-changes-name-on-init person=model}}
